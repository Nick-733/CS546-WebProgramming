      <h1>Story That Does't Make Sense !</h1>
      <main>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a talking pineapple named Fred. Fred loved to play the ukulele and dance the cha-cha, even though he had no arms or legs. One day, Fred decided to climb Mount Everest. He climbed and climbed until he reached the top, where he found a magical fairy who granted him three wishes.</p>
        <p>Fred wished for a pair of roller skates, a banana split, and a purple polka-dotted elephant. The fairy granted his wishes, and Fred happily skated down the mountain on his new roller skates, eating his banana split and riding his elephant.</p>
        <p>But then, as he was skating along, he accidentally ran into a giant spaghetti monster who was walking his pet tomato. The tomato got angry and started throwing meatballs at Fred, who used his ukulele to defend himself. Eventually, the spaghetti monster got bored and wandered away, leaving Fred to continue his journey with his new roller skates, banana split, and purple polka-dotted elephant.</p>
        <p>The end.</p>
